Which of the following is an advantage of a layered network architecture?

    - Easy to add an extra layer (fase and why would there be a need for a whole layer, lol)
    - Information that is available in one layer is automatically available in all layers (false).
    - By using these layers there's no redundancy. Any desired functionality needs to be implemented only once, in one layer.

ANSWER: Using layers makes it easy to make all kinds of hardware and systems 
work together. As long as a layer offers the agreed service to an upper layer, 
the actual technological implementation can be very different.

A computer network's transport layer could, in theory, offer many different services to the application layer. Some examples are:

Guaranteed minimum bandwidth for data transfer
Guaranteed maximum delay for data transfer
Reliable data transfer
Confidential data transfer
In reality, which of these services are offered by the Internet's transport layer?

ANSWER: RELIABLE DATA TRANSFER

Which transport protocol provides a connectionless service?

Answer:	UDP	


Which TCP service is described below?

This service allows the sender to match the rate at which it is sending data against the
