Which of the following is an advantage of a layered network architecture?

    - Easy to add an extra layer (fase and why would there be a need for a whole layer, lol)
    - Information that is available in one layer is automatically available in all layers (false).
    - By using these layers there's no redundancy. Any desired functionality needs to be implemented only once, in one layer.

ANSWER: Using layers makes it easy to make all kinds of hardware and systems 
work together. As long as a layer offers the agreed service to an upper layer, 
the actual technological implementation can be very different.
